# Percussion Scale Website

## Purpose of the program

I created this website for my percussion students.  Because of Covid and all the virtual learning going on, many of my students have been stuck at home with no mallet instrument to practice their scales.  This website allows percussion students to go through their major scale and interact with a virtual keyboard instrument. 

The program contains 3 seperate modes.  The first is a practice mode.  This mode allows students to pick the scales they want to work on and will cycle through these scales as long as the student would like. The program will tell them if they answered the scale correctly and will show them the correct answer if they miss a scale.  The second is a quiz mode.  The user will be asked to pick the scales on the quiz.  These scales when then be asked on the quiz in a random order.  Each question is timed and the student will be given a grade at the end of the quiz.  The last mode is a game mode.  The user will be asked all the major scales in a random order.  The sessions is timed and the user must answer all questions correct in order to receive their score (their time).  The goal is to achieve the fastest time.  

This program served its purpose well and was a good resource for helping my students.  

## Wesbite Construction
This site was built with html, css and jquery.  It is fully responsive and I was able to add google analytics to it so I can see how many people are using the site and when they are using it.
